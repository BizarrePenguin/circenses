A software for the secure management of any (sportings-)competition.

The idea is to provide a secure, stable and free software that can be easily operated by anyone to manage any (sportings-)competition from the small hip hop battle in the neighbourhood to an event with thousands of competitors.

## Technical ideas ðŸ’¡
- Standalone desktop application running on all the major pc operating systems using [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).
- Manage competitors, judging, certifications for competitors, state / progress of the competition, print results etc.
- Have a standardized system of creating a custom scores- / judging-system. Be able to share these. Provide default systems in an extra open source repository.
- Have a standardized system of creating the framework of a competition i.e. rounds like "first round", "semi-finale", "finale" with scores- / judging-systems associated with each round. Also provide default systems in an extra repository.
- Be able to start a server from the dekstop application with the click of a button that can serve role-based content to authorized users within the same local network to any device. Therefore e.g. judges can directly submit scores to the system via a mobile device and see their past judgements for comparison if wanted.
